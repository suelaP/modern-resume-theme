    Hi, my name is Suela and I am an agile practitioner with a history of working in the Open Source computer software industry. Mostly interested in Software quality assurance and product development, I am always trying to learn more about the best practices followed in the industry, especially among different open source projects, communities, and companies following an Open Source business model. I first got in touch with the Open Source movement at [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc), the first community in Albania focused in promoting software freedom, open-source software, free culture, online security, and knowledge sharing. Since <mark>2014</mark> I have been actively involved with Open Labs activities.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
