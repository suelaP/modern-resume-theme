    Hi, my name is Suela and I am an agile practitioner with a history of working in the Open Source computer software industry. Mostly interested in Software quality assurance and product development, I am always trying to learn more about the best practices followed in the industry, especially among different open source projects, communities, and companies following an Open Source business model. I first got in touch with the Open Source movement at [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc), the first community in Albania focused in promoting software freedom, open-source software, free culture, online security, and knowledge sharing. Since <mark>2014</mark> I have been actively involved with Open Labs activities.

    This is the "less boring" bit about me that most will probably still find boring. I usually enjoy long walks in the afternoon, scrolling random Reddit threads and procrastinating effectively by reading on topics I am not particularly interested in. I love sharing shower thoughts with friends who don't usually hesitate in using them against me whenever possible -- this can be quite fun from time to time. Whenever there is nothing to talk about I will talk about my cat, or how much I want a dog in my life ( now you know!). I am a bit of a chaotic person, but I am working in improving how I act upon my priorities hence this page, for me to publicly share what I supposed to be working on in the upcoming months -- public shamming seems to work! As a start -  On Monday, February 10 I am supposed to start learning Python and share my progress for 100 days (watch this space ;) )
